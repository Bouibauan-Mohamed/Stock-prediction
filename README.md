# Stock-prediction
The price of a financial security varies according to supply and demand in the markets.
  These two factors fluctuate with many events that may occur unexpectedly. They can be specific to the company or related to its environment.
In the first case, the price of a share can rise after the announcement of a surprise acquisition, or fall if it issues a profit warning.
In the second case, the share price of a listed company is likely to rise when one of its competitors experiences a decline in its shares, or fall if a country adopts regulations that are not favorable to its main activities.
Of course, investors cannot predict the future. However, several indicators can make it possible to form an opinion on the course that a share can reach in the days to come.
